# Extreme Rock Paper Scissors!

A browser game inspired by good old rock paper scissors and classic fighting games like Street Fighter.
The purpose of this small project of mine was to get better at vanilla javascript and css, specifically with positioning, animating, and media queries.
The game should be playable from **375px** and above.

## Game Length
There are 3 different game lengths that end the game when either you or the computer reach the chosen game length.
- Short: Up to 5 wins
- Medium: Up to 25 wins
- Long: Up to 100 wins

# Have fun!

### Secrets
There is a hidden playable character, and it isn't as hard as you think to unlock! üòÅ
